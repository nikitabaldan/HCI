We will focus on Mobile Apps, Desktop applications and ambient display that we can use and analyze.

## Mobile Apps


the first application that we are analyzinig is AirVisul, available on the Play store and Apple store.  
Air Visual is specialized in displaying informations about ari qualityusing a clean and easy-to-use interface.

We found this summary very helpful to have a quick glance on the situation of the air pollution in a certain area q

This is the main interface of AirVisual, as we can see the first thing that we notice is the summary of the air quality in a specific city.  
The specific parameters are hidden for now to give allow the user to "zoom out" on the air quality in a city.  

in our application we thought about implementig an istogram to visualize the data within a 15 window and the max value registered in those 15 days.

Swiping down we can see a more detailed view about the air quality in the selected city, showing a Daily/Hourly information about it.
